####Disclaimer

This is a project extended from a PluralSight tutorial I used to enhance my understanding of building web applications using React and Flux. None of the data here is persisted (saved to a server), so on refresh all data will return to it's initial state. I will update this in the future to include the ability to persist information on an actual server.
